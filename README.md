# Breast_Cancer
The Breast Cancer Prediction project aims to gain practical knowledge on how to apply logistic regression for classification tasks. It predict whether a breast cancer is malignant or benign based on various features. The dataset used for this project is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and has already been cleaned.

The project involves the implementation of a logistic regression model for breast cancer prediction. Logistic regression is a popular classification algorithm that is well-suited for binary classification tasks like this one. To ensure robust evaluation, k-fold cross-validation has been applied to compute the accuracy of the model.
